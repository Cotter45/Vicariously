# Vicariously

## This app is meant to be a clone of couchsurfing.com with a twist.

This site will allow users to post anything in their home to share with a new friend via vicariously. Some might choose to share their gorgeous backyard with a pool and pizza oven, while others may choose to share their master bathrooms with some road weary travellers. Everyone has something in their home that could go a long way to help a friend in need.

This site is meant for anyone, and any thing! Your new neighborhood is just a click away, whether you're on the road or even in the same town.

## To set up locally

1. Download the zip file

2. Open with preferred editor

3. Use the command 'npm install' in a terminal for both the front-end and back-end sections, the back-end will run on port 5000 and the front-end will run on port 3000

4. Use the command 'npm start' for each end, navigate to port 3000 to view the website, and port 5000 to make fetch calls to the api

5. Keep in mind this app uses JWT tokens for verification as well as csurf to prevent cross-site request forgery. Enjoy!
